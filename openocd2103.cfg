# #arm7_9 sw_bkpts enable
# arm7_9 force_hw_bkpts enable
# #  "arm7_9 force_hw_bkpts enable" disables sw_bkpts support and all breakpoints
# #  are turned into hardware breakpoints.


# #arm7_9 fast_memory_access enable
# # Allow OpenOCD to read and write memory without checking completion of operation.
# # This provides a huge speed up with USB JTAG cables (FT2232).
