( block 0  )

This block file, kernel.fth, is used to create a target image when
starting riscy.tcl this way:

    ./riscy.tcl -flash 1

(normally, though, that would be done by the makefile)

It will then load block 1 (in this file), which is the load 
block that will load other blocks.

Finally, at some point, SAVE-IMAGE must be executed in order
to save the results to the *.bin and *.dictionary files, 
e.g.,

    SAVE-IMAGE kernel INIT

would save the results to the files kernel.bin and 
kernel.dictionary and set the boot word to QUIT

load block for creating the flash image for Riscy Pygness

The ";;" after QUIT is defined switches back to interpret mode so the
additional blocks can be loaded.

The last line on the block saves the image to the names kernel.bin and
kernel.dictionary, while setting that the "boot" or startup word will be
QUIT. 

When controlled by the makefile, the image files will be renamed
appropriately for the specific ARM variant, such as kernel-lpc2106.bin
and kernel-lpc2106.dictionary.

( shadow 9  Multitasking )

LOCAL ( task a - a')

 Convert an address A local to the current task to an equivalent address
 local to the given task.  E.g.,   TASK1 RP0 LOCAL  answers the RP0 slot
 in TASK1's TCB.

AWAKE? ( task - a | 0)

 The LINK fields form a circular list which is, in effect, the active
 task list.  AWAKE?  checks to see if a given task is in the active task
 list.  If not, a zero is returned.  If it is, the address of the task
 that points to the given task is returned.  This is the link field that
 points to the task we were asking about.  Thus it is the field we need
 to alter if we wish to remove the task from the active list.

 The active task list is circular.  It is never empty, as the foreground
 task should never be put to sleep.  With a single task, the LINK field
 of that task contains the address of itself.

 Executing a task name returns the address of that task, which is the
 start of its user variables (i.e., the address of its LINK field).

 AWAKE? works by running through the LINKs to see if any of them contain
 an address that matches the given task.  We don't really need to know
 how many tasks are present in the LINKs as long as we know when to stop
 looking (when we get back to the one we started with).

SLEEP ( task -)

 Remove TASK from the active task list (if it is not the foreground task).

STOP ( -)

 Put the current task to sleep (if it is not the foreground task).


WAKE ( newtask -)

 Insert NEWTASK into the active task list.

( shadow 10  Multitasking )

TASK! ( word task -)

  Set (or reset) TASK so it will run the Forth WORD when it gets
  control.  The LINK, SP0, and RP0 slot have already been initialized.
  The TOS and RLOOP slots are "don't care".  We store the Forth WORD
  into the saved IP slot.  Then we set the saved DSTK and RSTK slots
  from the SP0 and RP0 slots.

  Note that TASK1 LINK $XX + LOCAL  is the same as  TASK1 $XX +
